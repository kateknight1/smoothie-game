# smoothie-game

I am trying to make a simple game about smoothies, similar to the Papa's franchise but simpler, without specific characters, and without emphasis on correct technique.

In the game, you are given an order - a list of ingredients to include in the smoothie. You add them to the blender. You press the button to blend them. You serve the smoothie. 

That's the aim.

## Roadmap

1. Create game loop
2. Add in characters to speak orders (using open-source assets).
